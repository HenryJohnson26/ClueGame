Tests will error and fail if all tests are run at once, but tests all pass when run individually. Not sure why it doesn't work when run all 
at once.

We had to add a line in the BoardAdjTargetTest306 file in the @BeforeEach because the tests were erroring due to an index error with the currentPlayer
variable being set to -1 to run the game, but never changed in the tests, and the line can't be changed to make the tests pass, so we changed the tests.
